lunabus
=======

first iteration of luna bus
I'm able to edit the readme file from the Github website. Cool!
And now I've added more text!

And now, a poem - 
We shall not cease from exploration, 
and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started
and know the place for the first time.
-
T. S. Eliot


In this fork, we've added a short joke.
When is a door not a door?
When it's ajar!!!
